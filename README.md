## Description

This application is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. It is built using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Usage

When first visiting the website, a user can view the homepage where all posts are visible. They can click on an individual post to see any comments that have been left on that post. In order to leave a comment on a post, they must be logged in, which they can do by clicking on the login tab in the navbar from any page view. If they are visiting the page for the first time, they must signup instead of logging in. Once logged in, they can view their dashboard which will display all of the posts they have created, and be given the option to create a new post.
